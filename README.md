Oberon RISC Emulator
====================

This is an emulator for the Oberon RISC machine. For more information, see:
http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/ and http://projectoberon.com/.

Requirements: a C99 compiler (e.g. [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/),
[clang](http://clang.llvm.org/)) and [SDL2](http://libsdl.org/).

A suitable disk image can be downloaded from http://projectoberon.com/ (in
S3RISCinstall.zip).


Command line options
--------------------

Usage: `risc [options] disk-image.img`

* `--fullscreen` Start the emulator in fullscreen mode.
* `--size <width>x<height>` Reduce the standard resolution of 1024x768.
  Useful on netbooks. This needs a change to the Oberon system, see
  [screen-size.patch](Oberon/screen-size.patch).
* `--serial-fd <fd>` Send serial I/O to file descriptor fd (input) and
  fd+1 (output). (You probably won't need this.)


Keyboard and mouse
------------------

The Oberon system assumes you have a US keyboard and a three button mouse.
You can use the left alt key to emulate a middle click.

The following keys are available:
* `Alt-F4` Quit the emulator.
* `F11` or `Shift-Command-F` Toggle fullscreen mode.
* `F12` Soft-reset the Oberon machine.


Transferring files
------------------

First start the PCLink1 task by middle-clicking on the PCLink1.Run command.
Transfer files using the pcreceive.sh and pcsend.sh scripts.


Clipboard integration
---------------------

Transfer and compile the Clipboard.Mod driver. This makes these commands
available:

* `Clipboard.Paste`
* `Clipboard.CopySelection`
* `Clipboard.CopyViewer`


Known issues
------------

* The wireless network interface is not emulated.
* Proper documentation is needed.
